## Quick Reference

### What Is TopologicSverchok

TopologicSverchok integrates the **topologicpy** non-manifold topology (NMT) library with Sverchok's parametric node system. It enables hierarchical and topological representations of architectural spaces, buildings, and artefacts through 326 nodes organized by topology class.

- **326 nodes** in the `nodes/Topologic/` directory
- **Non-manifold topology**: lines, surfaces, and volumes coexist simultaneously
- **AEC workflows**: envelope analysis, space adjacency, dual graphs, energy simulation
- **Integrations**: IFC (ifcopenshell), OpenStudio/EnergyPlus, Speckle, Neo4j, DGL
- **License**: AGPL-3.0
- **Repository**: https://github.com/wassimj/TopologicSverchok
- **Python API**: https://topologicpy.readthedocs.io

### Topology Class Hierarchy

| Class | Dimension | AEC Example | Key Nodes |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Vertex** | 0D | Column insertion point | `VertexByCoordinates`, `VertexEnclosingCell` |
| **Edge** | 1D | Structural beam axis | `EdgeByVertices`, `EdgeLength`, `EdgeDirection` |
| **Wire** | 1D composite | Room boundary outline | `WireByEdges`, `WireRectangle`, `WireIsClosed` |
| **Face** | 2D | Wall surface, floor slab | `FaceByEdges`, `FaceArea`, `FaceTrimByWire` |
| **Shell** | 2D composite | Building envelope | `ShellByFaces`, `ShellByLoft`, `ShellIsClosed` |
| **Cell** | 3D | Room volume | `CellByFaces`, `CellVolume`, `CellInternalVertex` |
| **CellComplex** | 3D non-manifold | Multi-room building | `CellComplexByFaces`, `CellComplexDecompose` |
| **Cluster** | Mixed | Building group | `ClusterByTopologies`, `ClusterType` |

### Critical Warnings

**NEVER** confuse Topologic topology objects with Blender mesh data — they are completely different representations. Convert with `TopologyByGeometry` (Blender to Topologic) or `TopologyBlenderGeometry` (Topologic to Blender).

**NEVER** pass raw Blender vertex coordinates directly to Topologic nodes — always use `VertexByCoordinates` to create Topologic Vertex objects first.

**NEVER** assume all faces in a CellComplex are planar — TopologicSverchok requires planar geometry; use `TopologyIsPlanar` to verify before building CellComplex structures.

**ALWAYS** check optional dependency availability before using IFC, Energy, Speckle, or Neo4j nodes — these require separate installations of ifcopenshell, OpenStudio, specklepy, or py2neo.

**ALWAYS** use `CellComplexDecompose` to categorize faces as external/internal/non-manifold before querying building envelope — non-manifold faces are shared between cells and should not be treated as exterior surfaces.

## Essential Patterns

### Pattern 1: Build a CellComplex from Blender Geometry

```
Sverchok node tree setup:
Object In (Blender object) -> [vertices, edges, faces]
   -> TopologyByGeometry (Topology object)
   -> CellComplexByFaces (CellComplex)
   -> CellComplexDecompose (external faces, internal faces, non-manifold faces)
```

The `TopologyByGeometry` node converts Blender mesh data (vertex coordinates + face indices) into a Topologic Topology. Planar geometry only — non-planar faces will cause errors. `CellComplexByFaces` merges all faces into a non-manifold structure where shared faces become internal boundaries between cells.

### Pattern 2: Room Adjacency Graph

```
CellComplex
   -> GraphByTopology (direct=True, viaSharedTopologies=True, toExteriorTopologies=False)
   -> Graph object
      -> GraphVertices -> list of room vertices
      -> GraphEdges -> list of shared-wall edges
      -> GraphShortestPath (vertexA, vertexB) -> Wire path
      -> GraphDepthMap (startVertex) -> distance map
```

`GraphByTopology` creates a dual graph where each Cell becomes a vertex and shared Faces (internal walls/slabs) become edges. Set `direct=True` for cell-to-cell edges via shared faces. The output Graph supports all standard graph operations (shortest path, centrality, community detection).

### Pattern 3: Building Envelope Analysis

```
CellComplex
   -> CellComplexDecompose
      -> externalFaces -> FaceArea (total envelope area)
      -> internalFaces -> FaceArea (total internal surface area)
      -> nonManifoldFaces -> (shared between cells — zero-thickness boundaries)
   -> filter externalFaces by FaceFacingToward (direction=[0,0,1]) -> roof faces
   -> filter externalFaces by FaceFacingToward (direction=[0,0,-1]) -> floor faces
   -> remaining externalFaces -> wall faces
```

### Pattern 4: Energy Simulation from Topology

```
CellComplex (building geometry)
   -> EnergyModelByTopology (
        building=cellcomplex,
        weatherFilePath="path/to/weather.epw",
        floorLevels=[0, 3, 6, 9],
        glazingRatio=0.4,
        coolingTemp=25.0,
        heatingTemp=20.0
      )
   -> EnergyModel
      -> EnergyModelRunSimulation (osBinaryPath, outputFolder)
      -> EnergyModelQuery (reportName, tableName, columnName)
      -> simulation results (heating/cooling loads)
```

### Pattern 5: IFC to Topologic Workflow

```
IFCReadFile (path) -> IFC file object
   -> IFCBuildingElements (ifc, elementType="IfcWall") -> wall topologies
   -> TopologyByImportedIFC -> Topology objects
   -> CellComplexByFaces -> building topology
   -> GraphByTopology -> adjacency graph
```

Alternatively use `EnergyModelByImportedIFC` for direct IFC-to-energy-model conversion without intermediate topology steps.
