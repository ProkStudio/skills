## Quick Reference

### Critical Rules

**NEVER** store direct `bpy.data` references (objects, meshes, materials) across undo/redo, file load, or file revert operations — ALL Python pointers to Blender data are invalidated.

**NEVER** access a data block after calling `bpy.data.<collection>.remove()` on it — the StructRNA is freed and access raises `ReferenceError`.

**NEVER** assume `bpy.data.<collection>.new(name)` returns the exact name you passed — Blender appends `.001`, `.002`, etc. when a name already exists.

**NEVER** keep references to `CollectionProperty` items across `.add()` or `.remove()` calls — the underlying C array is re-allocated, invalidating all prior element pointers.

**NEVER** use `del obj["prop"]` to reset RNA-defined properties in Blender 5.0+ — use `obj.property_unset("prop")` instead.

**NEVER** use `obj["cycles"]` dict-like access for system properties in Blender 5.0+ — system properties are separated from custom properties.

**ALWAYS** store object/data block names (strings) or stable identifiers instead of direct `bpy` references when the reference must survive across operator execution, undo, or file operations.

**ALWAYS** re-fetch references from `bpy.data.<collection>` using `.get(name)` before accessing data that may have been invalidated.

**ALWAYS** store the return value of `bpy.data.<collection>.new()` directly in a variable — do not look up by name afterward.

**ALWAYS** use `bpy.data.objects.get(name)` (returns `None`) instead of `bpy.data.objects[name]` (raises `KeyError`) when the data block may not exist.

### Error Identification Table

| `ReferenceError` after Ctrl+Z | Undo invalidated all bpy references | [Undo Invalidation](#error-2-undo-invalidates-all-references) |
| `KeyError: 'bpy_prop_collection[key] not found'` | Name collision — Blender renamed the data block | [Name Collision](#error-3-name-collision-on-data-creation) |

### Decision Tree: Safe Data Access

```
Need to reference a Blender data block?
├── Will you use it immediately (same function, no operators called)?
│   └── YES → Direct reference is safe: obj = bpy.data.objects["Cube"]
├── Will an operator with undo run between store and access?
│   └── YES → Store NAME, re-fetch later: name = obj.name
├── Will undo/redo possibly occur (modal operator, interactive use)?
│   └── YES → Store NAME, re-fetch on every access
├── Will file load/revert occur?
│   └── YES → Store NAME, re-fetch after load_post handler fires
└── Will CollectionProperty.add()/remove() be called?
    └── YES → Re-fetch ALL element references after modification
```

### Decision Tree: Diagnosing ReferenceError

```
Got ReferenceError: StructRNA of type X has been removed?
├── Did you call bpy.data.<collection>.remove() on this data?
│   └── YES → Do not access the variable after remove()
├── Did undo/redo happen since you obtained the reference?
│   └── YES → Re-fetch by name from bpy.data
├── Did a file load/revert happen?
│   └── YES → Re-fetch by name from bpy.data
├── Is this inside a modal operator?
│   └── YES → Store name in operator property, re-fetch each modal() call
└── Did you switch modes (Edit → Object)?
    └── YES → Re-fetch mesh data references after mode switch
```

## Error 1: ReferenceError from Removed Data

When a data block is removed via `bpy.data.<collection>.remove()`, ANY Python variable still pointing to that data raises `ReferenceError` on access.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("TempMesh")
bpy.data.meshes.remove(mesh)
print(mesh.name)  # ReferenceError: StructRNA of type Mesh has been removed

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("TempMesh")
mesh_name = mesh.name  # Save name before removal if needed
bpy.data.meshes.remove(mesh)
mesh = None  # Explicitly clear the reference
```

**Cascading removal**: Removing an object does NOT automatically remove its data. Removing a mesh does NOT automatically remove objects using it. Track dependencies manually.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: Safe removal of object AND its data
obj = bpy.data.objects.get("MyObject")
if obj:
    mesh = obj.data
    bpy.data.objects.remove(obj)
    if mesh and mesh.users == 0:
        bpy.data.meshes.remove(mesh)
```

---

## Error 2: Undo Invalidates ALL References

When undo or redo occurs, Blender rebuilds the entire data model from its undo history. ALL Python references to `bpy.types.ID` subclasses (objects, meshes, materials, scenes, etc.) become invalid. This is the single most dangerous data access pitfall.

**When invalidation occurs:**
- `bpy.ops.ed.undo()` / `bpy.ops.ed.redo()`
- Interactive Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z by the user
- `bpy.ops.wm.open_mainfile()` (file load)
- `bpy.ops.wm.revert_mainfile()` (file revert)
- Any operator with built-in undo support that the user subsequently undoes

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN: reference held across undo
obj = bpy.data.objects["Cube"]
bpy.ops.ed.undo()
obj.location.x = 1.0  # ReferenceError or crash

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT: store name, re-fetch
obj_name = bpy.data.objects["Cube"].name
bpy.ops.ed.undo()
obj = bpy.data.objects.get(obj_name)
if obj is not None:
    obj.location.x = 1.0
```

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for the `SafeObjectRef` wrapper pattern.

## Error 3: Name Collision on Data Creation

Blender enforces unique names within each `bpy.data` collection. When you create a data block with a name that already exists, Blender silently appends `.001`, `.002`, etc.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN: assuming exact name
bpy.data.meshes.new(name="MyMesh")
mesh = bpy.data.meshes["MyMesh"]  # KeyError if "MyMesh" already existed — it became "MyMesh.001"

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT: capture return value
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(name="MyMesh")  # Returns the actual data block
print(mesh.name)  # May be "MyMesh.001" — use this variable, never look up by name
```

**Renaming also triggers this**: If you set `obj.name = "Cube"` but "Cube" already exists, Blender renames the OTHER object to "Cube.001". Code storing the old name of the other object will break.

---

## Error 4: Stale CollectionProperty References

`CollectionProperty` elements are stored in a contiguous C array. Calling `.add()` or `.remove()` may re-allocate the entire array, invalidating ALL Python references to existing elements.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN: stale pointer after re-allocation
items = bpy.context.scene.my_collection
first_item = items.add()
first_item.name = "First"

for i in range(100):
    items.add()  # May re-allocate entire array

first_item.name = "Updated"  # CRASH or undefined behavior — pointer is invalid

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT: re-fetch by index after modifications
items = bpy.context.scene.my_collection
items.add()
items[len(items) - 1].name = "First"

for i in range(100):
    items.add()

items[0].name = "Updated"  # Safe — accessed by index, not stale pointer
```

---

## Error 5: File Operations Invalidate References

File load and revert rebuild the entire data model, identical to undo invalidation. References obtained before the file operation are invalid.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN
obj = bpy.data.objects["Wall"]
bpy.ops.wm.open_mainfile(filepath="/path/to/other.blend")
print(obj.name)  # ReferenceError — entire data model was replaced

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT: use load_post handler
from bpy.app.handlers import persistent

@persistent
def on_file_loaded(filepath):
    obj = bpy.data.objects.get("Wall")
    if obj:
        print(f"Found Wall in new file: {obj.name}")

bpy.app.handlers.load_post.append(on_file_loaded)
```

---

## Error 6: Blender 5.0 IDProperty Separation

Blender 5.0 separates system-defined properties (RNA properties defined via `bpy.props`) from user-defined custom properties. Dict-like access to system properties is removed.

```python
# Blender 4.x: Works (but deprecated)
value = bpy.context.scene["cycles"]  # Accesses Cycles settings via dict syntax
del obj["my_rna_prop"]               # Resets RNA property via dict deletion

# Blender 5.0+: BROKEN
value = bpy.context.scene["cycles"]  # KeyError — system props not in dict
del obj["my_rna_prop"]               # Fails for RNA-defined properties

# Blender 5.0+: CORRECT
value = bpy.context.scene.cycles     # Access via attribute
obj.property_unset("my_rna_prop")    # Reset RNA property to default

# Custom properties still use dict access in ALL versions
obj["my_custom_prop"] = 42           # Works in 3.x/4.x/5.x
value = obj["my_custom_prop"]        # Works in 3.x/4.x/5.x
del obj["my_custom_prop"]            # Works in 3.x/4.x/5.x
```

**Migration for legacy files**: Blender 5.0 auto-duplicates old IDProperties into system storage when opening pre-5.0 files. Clean up with:

```python
# Blender 5.0+: Cleanup duplicated IDProperties from legacy files
for ob in bpy.data.objects:
    sys_props = ob.bl_system_properties_get()
    # Migrate values if needed, then remove old custom prop duplicates
```

---

## Mode Switching Invalidates Mesh Data

Switching between Edit Mode and Object Mode re-allocates mesh data arrays. References to `mesh.vertices`, `mesh.polygons`, `mesh.edges`, and UV layers obtained before the switch are invalid.

```python
# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: BROKEN
verts = bpy.context.active_object.data.vertices
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
print(verts[0].co)  # Crash or stale data — verts pointer is invalid

# Blender 3.x/4.x/5.x: CORRECT: re-fetch after mode switch
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
verts = bpy.context.active_object.data.vertices  # Re-fetch
print(verts[0].co)  # Safe
```

## Safe Data Access Patterns Summary

| Pattern | When to Use | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Store name, re-fetch | Modal operators, handlers, any long-lived reference | `name = obj.name` → `bpy.data.objects.get(name)` |
| Use `.get()` not `[]` | Any lookup where data may not exist | `bpy.data.objects.get("X")` returns `None` |
| Capture return value | After `.new()` calls | `mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("X")` |
| Re-fetch after collection mutation | After `.add()` / `.remove()` on CollectionProperty | Access by index, not stored reference |
| Null-check after re-fetch | After undo, file load, or any invalidation point | `if obj is not None:` |
| Use `@persistent` on handlers | Any handler in an addon | Without it, handler is removed on file load |
